# Rules

2048 is a single-player sliding puzzle game where the objective is to combine numbered tiles to create a tile with the number 2048. Here are the basic rules and placement conditions for the tiles:

## Basic Rules:

- _Grid_: The game is played on a 4x4 grid.
- _Starting Tiles_: At the beginning of the game, two tiles are randomly placed on the grid, either a 2 or a 4.
- _Movement_: Players can slide the tiles in four directions: up, down, left, or right. When two tiles with the same number touch, they combine into one tile with the sum of their values (e.g., two 2s combine to form a 4).
- _Winning_: The goal is to reach the tile with the number 2048. However, players can continue playing to achieve higher scores.
- _Losing_: The game ends when there are no valid moves left (i.e., no empty spaces and no adjacent tiles with the same number).

## Placement of 2 and 4:

- _Initial Placement_: The game starts with two tiles on the board, which can be a combination of one 2 and one 4 or two 2s. The placement of these tiles is random, but they will appear in empty spaces on the grid.
- _Subsequent Placements_: Every time you make a move, a new tile (either a 2 or a 4) is randomly placed in one of the empty spaces on the grid. The new tile is typically a 2, but there is a 10% chance it will be a 4.
  Summary:

## 2 and 4 can be placed:

- At the start of the game (initial random placement).
- After each move, in any empty space on the grid (with 90% chance of being a 2 and 10% chance of being a 4).
  This random placement and combination mechanic is what makes the game challenging and engaging.
